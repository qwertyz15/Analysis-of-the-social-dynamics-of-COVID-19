The agency said corona would reduce trade by 13 to 23 percent this year. News Parstuder. The World Trade Organization (WTO) says the collapse of global stock markets could lead to a bigger economic crisis this year than the one in 2008. As governments are forced to allocate large sums of money to prevent epidemics, world trade and production will fall sharply and unemployment will rise sharply. It is clear that the world economy has already collapsed due to the isolation or quarantine of billions of people. The transport and tourism industries have become obsolete. Trade between trade-dependent countries is coming to a halt. Experts fear that the coronavirus may last a long time. As a result, the economic situation will become more dire. Because, with the goal of controlling coronavirus, the human society of the world will be forced to stop all kinds of communications and gatherings for some more time. As a result, economic activity will be very limited. The big economic powers and the emerging developed nations are already struggling to cope with the economic turmoil caused by the Corona. So it is easy to imagine how bad the situation will be in poor countries. The 1930s were the worst economic crisis in history. But experts fear the impending recession could be even more dire. The most difficult crisis in contemporary history can only be tackled by maintaining safe health care systems, as well as by inventing vaccines or drugs against corona and increasing production in large quantities and extending a helping hand to the poor by the government and the rich.

বাইরে থেকে আসা কোনও রাসায়নিক বস্তুকে কোষের ভিতর ঢুকতে দেবে কি দেবে না, তা নির্ধারণ করে। যে কোনও ভাইরাসের বাইরের আবরণ দিয়েই রিসেপ্টর ভাইরাসের রাসায়নিক গঠন বুঝতে পারে এবং ভাইরাসকে কোষের ভিতরে প্রবেশের পথ তৈরি করে দেয়। ভাইরাসের বাইরের আবরণের গঠনে একটু এ দিক-ও দিক হলেই রিসেপ্টর আর ভাইরাসের গঠন বুঝতে পারে না। তা হলে কি রিসেপ্টর ক্ষতিকর? ভাইরাসকে ঢুকতে দেবে কেন কোষে? উত্তর হল, না। রিসেপ্টার ক্ষতিকর রাসায়নিক পদার্থকে অন্য রাসায়নিক পদার্থের সঙ্গে আলাদা করে চিনতে পারে না। রিসেপ্টর কেবল রাসায়নিক গঠন চিনে ভাইরাসকে কোষে প্রবেশ করতে দেয়। সুতরাং, ভাইরাসের ওই বাইরের আবরণটি নষ্ট হওয়া, ভাইরাসের আইডেন্টিটি কার্ড বা পরিচয়পত্র হারিয়ে ফেলার মতোই। ২০০৮ সালে আমেরিকার আরিজোনা স্টেট ইউনিভার্সিটির পদার্থবিদ অটো স্যাঙ্কি এবং তার ছাত্র এরিক ডাইকম্যান একটি পদ্ধতি আবিষ্কার করেন, যার ফলে ভাইরাসের প্রতিটি পরমাণুর কম্পাঙ্ক হিসেব করা যায়। স্যাঙ্কি ওই সালে জানুয়ারি সংখ্যার ‘ফিজিক্যাল রিভিউ’ জার্নালে লেখেন, মাত্র ৬০ গিগাহার্টজ কম্পাঙ্কে টোবাকো নেক্রোসিস নামে একটি প্লান্ট ভাইরাসকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করতে সক্ষম হন। তার কিছু দিন পরেই আরিজোনা স্টেট ইউনিভার্সিটির আর এক গবেষক প্রমাণ করেন, লেজার আলো দিয়ে ভাইরাসের ভিতরকার অণু-পরমাণুতে তীব্র কম্পন তৈরি করা যায়। এর ফলে ভাইরাসগুলো কম্পনের ফলেই মারা যাবে। ২০১৫ সালে বিজ্ঞানী শু ইয়ং ‘নেচার’ পত্রিকায় প্রথম দেখান ৮-১০ গিগাহার্টজ শক্তিবিশিষ্ট মাইক্রোওয়েভ দিয়ে ইনফ্লুয়েঞ্জা ভাইরাসের একদম বাইরের আবরণ অর্থাৎ ক্যাপসিড নষ্ট করা যায়। এখানে লেজার কিন্তু অনেক বেশি কম্পাঙ্কের, অর্থাৎ তীব্র ক্ষমতাযুক্ত। ১৯৯১ সালে আমেরিকার ইউনিভার্সিটি অব ইলিনয়-এর এক দল গবেষক ‘অ্যাপ্লায়েড অ্যান্ড এনভায়রনমেন্টাল মাইক্রোবায়োলজি’ জার্নালে প্রকাশ করেন ২৬ কিলোহার্টজ-এর আল্ট্রাসনিক ফ্রিকোয়েন্সি দিয়ে ফেলিন হার্পিস ভাইরাস (এফএইচভি-১)’এর একদম বাইরের আবরণ অর্থাৎ এনভেলপ নষ্ট করা যায়। ফেলিন হার্পিস ভাইরাস প্রজাতির মধ্যে হিউম্যান হার্পিস ভাইরাস, হার্পিস সিমপ্লেক্স ভাইরাস টাইপ ওয়ান এবং টু-ও অন্তর্গত। অর্থাৎ, এই কম্পাঙ্ক প্রয়োগ করে এই ভাইরাসগুলোর এনভেলপ নষ্ট করা এবং এই ভাইরাসগুলোকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করা সম্ভব। এই ভাইরাসগুলো ত্বকের কিউটিন স্তরের রক্তপরিবাহী অংশে ক্ষত সৃষ্টি করে এবং মূত্রনালীতে সংক্রমণ করে। কিন্তু সমস্যা হয় ক্যালিসিফেরাস ভাইরাসদের নিয়ে। ২৬ কিলোহার্টজ আল্ট্রাসনিক সাউন্ড দিয়েও এদের নষ্ট করা যায় না। কারণ এদের এনভেলপ থাকে না, এদের থাকে ক্যাপসিড। যার সাহায্যে এরা মানুষের শরীরে প্রবেশ করে। এই ক্যাপসিড ভাঙা কিন্তু ভাইরাসের এনভেলপ ভাঙার মতো সোজা নয়। এই গবেষণায় একটাই জিনিস শেষে প্রমাণিত হয়, এনভেলপ-যুক্ত ভাইরাস বাহ্যিক শক্তির প্রয়োগে সহজে নষ্ট হয়, কিন্তু ক্যাপসিড-যুক্ত ভাইরাসের ক্ষেত্রে তা হয় না। এই মুহূর্তে নোভেল করোনাভাইরাস বা কোভিড-১৯’এর ভয়ে সারা পৃথিবী তটস্থ। খুব অল্প সময়ে ছড়িয়ে পড়ার কারণে এখনও গবেষণা করে দেখা হয়নি যে নোভেল করোনাভাইরাসের উপর ঠিক কত কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ প্রয়োগ করে তাকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করা যেতে পারে। তবে পুরনো গবেষণা বলছে, বেশ তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ প্রয়োজন যে কোনও ভাইরাস মোকাবিলা করতে। এ ক্ষেত্রে বলে রাখা ভাল, শাঁখ, কাঁসর, ঘণ্টা, থালা-বাটি এবং হাততালি মাত্র কয়েক হার্টজ কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ উৎপাদন করে। শুরুতে রেজোন্যান্স ফ্রিকোয়েন্সির কথা বলছিলাম। শব্দের উৎস, অর্থাৎ কাসর, ঢাক-ঢোল, খোল-করতাল ইত্যাদিতে বাহ্যিক শক্তি প্রয়োগ করলে তখনই আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড অর্থাৎ তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ তৈরি হবে, যখন বাহ্যিক শক্তিও তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের হবে। মানুষের শরীরে সেই অতিমানবীয় শক্তি নেই, যা দিয়ে সে তীব্র কম্পাঙ্ক তৈরি করে কাঁসর, খোল-করতাল, শাঁখ কিংবা হাততালির মাধ্যমে আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড তৈরি করে করোনার মতো ভাইরাসকে নষ্ট করবে। করতাল, ঝাঁঝ, কাঁসর কিংবা ঘণ্টা ধাতু নির্মিত। আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড সেখান থেকে অবশ্যই তৈরি হতে পারে। যেমন, ধাতুতে লেজার প্রয়োগ করে আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড তৈরি করা গিয়েছে। প্রসঙ্গত, লেজারের কম্পাঙ্ক এক লক্ষ কোটির বেশি। দল বেধে থালা-বাটি বাজিয়ে ভাইরাস তাড়ানোর উৎসব পালন করা অজ্ঞতারই পরিচয়। বরং রবিবারের বিকেলে এত বেশি লোকজন জমায়েত হয়ে যে উৎসব পালন করেছেন তাতে ভাইরাস সংক্রমণই আরও বেশি করে নিশ্চিত হয়েছে।',\n"," 'In the last 24 hours, 989 more coronavirus infections have been detected in the country.

Recently, the head of the World Health Organization said that no country should leave the lockdown now. Because, the danger is not over yet. According to the World Health Organization, there is no direct evidence that coronary antibodies have been produced in the body. So the treatment of corona is not going to be dependent on plasma therapy right now. In support of this view of the World Health Organization, a professor of viruses at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Mohali, India, Dr. Indranil Bandyopadhyay said, “Once a person recovers from corona, he will not be infected with this virus again, it is not at all. The opposite has happened. In Argentina, Italy and even Maharashtra in India, the same person has been hit twice by corona. ”\\nDr. \"Coronavirus can be active in the human body for up to 36 days, not 14 days or 20 days,\" Banerjee said. A recent study by French scientists found such evidence. As a result, once a person recovers during this period, he or she may relapse into corona due to some carelessness or a weak body. ” So can plasma therapy increase the risk of viral infection in this situation? Dr. Banerjee said, “Maybe not. This is because, before collecting blood juice or plasma, it is tested more than once. So there is almost no risk of coronary infection from blood juices or plasma. However, a person infected with corona is not completely safe even after recovery. This is because the fear of infection persists for up to 36 days after a person becomes infected with the virus. ” In this context, Dr. According to a research paper published in the Lancet medical journal, the coronavirus remains highly active for the first 20 days after entering the human body. After 20 days it starts to weaken gradually. However, the fear of infection persists for up to 36 days.

But do you know the origin of the word quarantine, do you know where the word actually came from? Let's find out. Speaking of the fourteenth century. One of the various routes of international trade was the Silk Route, which stretched from Asia through the Mediterranean to Greece and Italy in Europe. Probably in 1340, a deadly disease spread to Europe along this Silk Route trade route from Central Asia, affecting millions of people. The name of the disease is 'bubonic plague'. The incurable disease is called 'Black Death'. When the disease re-emerged in Europe in 1363, the administrative authorities in the Italian port city of Venice decided that much had happened, and no more. The decision was made to ban the ship from entering Venice as soon as it was suspected that there was a plague patient on a ship coming from outside. The ship must wait forty days on an island before entering Venice. Forty is called 'quarantena' in Italian. And those forty days of waiting time to prevent infection were called ‘quarantinero’. That is the origin of the English word 'quarantine'.

The Global Disaster Recovery Group (DRI) has expressed such fears. The company mainly helps to keep the business afloat in the aftermath of various crises. According to them, when Corona re-launches the economy, many businesses will not be able to recover. In such a situation, small traders will be most at risk. To survive in a crisis like Corona, they have to go back to the path of the new entrepreneur. Because DRI thinks that it is very difficult to start a business once it is closed. He said businesses need to take effective measures to adapt to the corona lockdown. In every country and in the world, those who do not have timely creativity in business and trade will have to face the most adversity. Their corona will definitely be in a difficult situation next time. However, those who have alternative management and thinking to avoid prudence and risk in business do not have to suffer at this time. Chloe Demrovsky thinks that the crisis caused by the Corona will be the worst for small businesses in the future. Many will not be able to resume business, many institutions will be closed. Meanwhile, according to DRI experts, businesses and large companies need to take effective steps to address the Corona crisis. Every organization needs to make timely changes in its work time and responsibilities and adapt to the post-crisis situation.

The agency said corona would reduce trade by 13 to 23 percent this year. News Parstuder. The World Trade Organization (WTO) says the collapse of global stock markets could lead to a bigger economic crisis this year than the one in 2008. As governments are forced to allocate large sums of money to prevent epidemics, world trade and production will fall sharply and unemployment will rise sharply. It is clear that the world economy has already collapsed due to the isolation or quarantine of billions of people. The transport and tourism industries have become obsolete. Trade between trade-dependent countries is coming to a halt. Experts fear that the coronavirus may last a long time. As a result, the economic situation will become more dire. Because, with the goal of controlling coronavirus, the human society of the world will be forced to stop all kinds of communications and gatherings for some more time. As a result, economic activity will be very limited. The big economic powers and the emerging developed nations are already struggling to cope with the economic turmoil caused by the Corona. So it is easy to imagine how bad the situation will be in poor countries. The 1930s were the worst economic crisis in history. But experts fear the impending recession could be even more dire. The most difficult crisis in contemporary history can only be tackled by maintaining safe health care systems, as well as by inventing vaccines or drugs against corona and increasing production in large quantities and extending a helping hand to the poor by the government and the rich.

বাইরে থেকে আসা কোনও রাসায়নিক বস্তুকে কোষের ভিতর ঢুকতে দেবে কি দেবে না, তা নির্ধারণ করে। যে কোনও ভাইরাসের বাইরের আবরণ দিয়েই রিসেপ্টর ভাইরাসের রাসায়নিক গঠন বুঝতে পারে এবং ভাইরাসকে কোষের ভিতরে প্রবেশের পথ তৈরি করে দেয়। ভাইরাসের বাইরের আবরণের গঠনে একটু এ দিক-ও দিক হলেই রিসেপ্টর আর ভাইরাসের গঠন বুঝতে পারে না। তা হলে কি রিসেপ্টর ক্ষতিকর? ভাইরাসকে ঢুকতে দেবে কেন কোষে? উত্তর হল, না। রিসেপ্টার ক্ষতিকর রাসায়নিক পদার্থকে অন্য রাসায়নিক পদার্থের সঙ্গে আলাদা করে চিনতে পারে না। রিসেপ্টর কেবল রাসায়নিক গঠন চিনে ভাইরাসকে কোষে প্রবেশ করতে দেয়। সুতরাং, ভাইরাসের ওই বাইরের আবরণটি নষ্ট হওয়া, ভাইরাসের আইডেন্টিটি কার্ড বা পরিচয়পত্র হারিয়ে ফেলার মতোই। ২০০৮ সালে আমেরিকার আরিজোনা স্টেট ইউনিভার্সিটির পদার্থবিদ অটো স্যাঙ্কি এবং তার ছাত্র এরিক ডাইকম্যান একটি পদ্ধতি আবিষ্কার করেন, যার ফলে ভাইরাসের প্রতিটি পরমাণুর কম্পাঙ্ক হিসেব করা যায়। স্যাঙ্কি ওই সালে জানুয়ারি সংখ্যার ‘ফিজিক্যাল রিভিউ’ জার্নালে লেখেন, মাত্র ৬০ গিগাহার্টজ কম্পাঙ্কে টোবাকো নেক্রোসিস নামে একটি প্লান্ট ভাইরাসকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করতে সক্ষম হন। তার কিছু দিন পরেই আরিজোনা স্টেট ইউনিভার্সিটির আর এক গবেষক প্রমাণ করেন, লেজার আলো দিয়ে ভাইরাসের ভিতরকার অণু-পরমাণুতে তীব্র কম্পন তৈরি করা যায়। এর ফলে ভাইরাসগুলো কম্পনের ফলেই মারা যাবে। ২০১৫ সালে বিজ্ঞানী শু ইয়ং ‘নেচার’ পত্রিকায় প্রথম দেখান ৮-১০ গিগাহার্টজ শক্তিবিশিষ্ট মাইক্রোওয়েভ দিয়ে ইনফ্লুয়েঞ্জা ভাইরাসের একদম বাইরের আবরণ অর্থাৎ ক্যাপসিড নষ্ট করা যায়। এখানে লেজার কিন্তু অনেক বেশি কম্পাঙ্কের, অর্থাৎ তীব্র ক্ষমতাযুক্ত। ১৯৯১ সালে আমেরিকার ইউনিভার্সিটি অব ইলিনয়-এর এক দল গবেষক ‘অ্যাপ্লায়েড অ্যান্ড এনভায়রনমেন্টাল মাইক্রোবায়োলজি’ জার্নালে প্রকাশ করেন ২৬ কিলোহার্টজ-এর আল্ট্রাসনিক ফ্রিকোয়েন্সি দিয়ে ফেলিন হার্পিস ভাইরাস (এফএইচভি-১)’এর একদম বাইরের আবরণ অর্থাৎ এনভেলপ নষ্ট করা যায়। ফেলিন হার্পিস ভাইরাস প্রজাতির মধ্যে হিউম্যান হার্পিস ভাইরাস, হার্পিস সিমপ্লেক্স ভাইরাস টাইপ ওয়ান এবং টু-ও অন্তর্গত। অর্থাৎ, এই কম্পাঙ্ক প্রয়োগ করে এই ভাইরাসগুলোর এনভেলপ নষ্ট করা এবং এই ভাইরাসগুলোকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করা সম্ভব। এই ভাইরাসগুলো ত্বকের কিউটিন স্তরের রক্তপরিবাহী অংশে ক্ষত সৃষ্টি করে এবং মূত্রনালীতে সংক্রমণ করে। কিন্তু সমস্যা হয় ক্যালিসিফেরাস ভাইরাসদের নিয়ে। ২৬ কিলোহার্টজ আল্ট্রাসনিক সাউন্ড দিয়েও এদের নষ্ট করা যায় না। কারণ এদের এনভেলপ থাকে না, এদের থাকে ক্যাপসিড। যার সাহায্যে এরা মানুষের শরীরে প্রবেশ করে। এই ক্যাপসিড ভাঙা কিন্তু ভাইরাসের এনভেলপ ভাঙার মতো সোজা নয়। এই গবেষণায় একটাই জিনিস শেষে প্রমাণিত হয়, এনভেলপ-যুক্ত ভাইরাস বাহ্যিক শক্তির প্রয়োগে সহজে নষ্ট হয়, কিন্তু ক্যাপসিড-যুক্ত ভাইরাসের ক্ষেত্রে তা হয় না। এই মুহূর্তে নোভেল করোনাভাইরাস বা কোভিড-১৯’এর ভয়ে সারা পৃথিবী তটস্থ। খুব অল্প সময়ে ছড়িয়ে পড়ার কারণে এখনও গবেষণা করে দেখা হয়নি যে নোভেল করোনাভাইরাসের উপর ঠিক কত কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ প্রয়োগ করে তাকে নিষ্ক্রিয় করা যেতে পারে। তবে পুরনো গবেষণা বলছে, বেশ তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ প্রয়োজন যে কোনও ভাইরাস মোকাবিলা করতে। এ ক্ষেত্রে বলে রাখা ভাল, শাঁখ, কাঁসর, ঘণ্টা, থালা-বাটি এবং হাততালি মাত্র কয়েক হার্টজ কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ উৎপাদন করে। শুরুতে রেজোন্যান্স ফ্রিকোয়েন্সির কথা বলছিলাম। শব্দের উৎস, অর্থাৎ কাসর, ঢাক-ঢোল, খোল-করতাল ইত্যাদিতে বাহ্যিক শক্তি প্রয়োগ করলে তখনই আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড অর্থাৎ তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের শব্দ তৈরি হবে, যখন বাহ্যিক শক্তিও তীব্র কম্পাঙ্কের হবে। মানুষের শরীরে সেই অতিমানবীয় শক্তি নেই, যা দিয়ে সে তীব্র কম্পাঙ্ক তৈরি করে কাঁসর, খোল-করতাল, শাঁখ কিংবা হাততালির মাধ্যমে আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড তৈরি করে করোনার মতো ভাইরাসকে নষ্ট করবে। করতাল, ঝাঁঝ, কাঁসর কিংবা ঘণ্টা ধাতু নির্মিত। আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড সেখান থেকে অবশ্যই তৈরি হতে পারে। যেমন, ধাতুতে লেজার প্রয়োগ করে আল্ট্রাসাউন্ড তৈরি করা গিয়েছে। প্রসঙ্গত, লেজারের কম্পাঙ্ক এক লক্ষ কোটির বেশি। দল বেধে থালা-বাটি বাজিয়ে ভাইরাস তাড়ানোর উৎসব পালন করা অজ্ঞতারই পরিচয়। বরং রবিবারের বিকেলে এত বেশি লোকজন জমায়েত হয়ে যে উৎসব পালন করেছেন তাতে ভাইরাস সংক্রমণই আরও বেশি করে নিশ্চিত হয়েছে।',\n"," 'In the last 24 hours, 989 more coronavirus infections have been detected in the country.

Recently, the head of the World Health Organization said that no country should leave the lockdown now. Because, the danger is not over yet. According to the World Health Organization, there is no direct evidence that coronary antibodies have been produced in the body.

As a result, once a person recovers during this period, he or she may relapse into corona due to some carelessness or a weak body. ” So can plasma therapy increase the risk of viral infection in this situation? Dr. Banerjee said, “Maybe not. This is because, before collecting blood juice or plasma, it is tested more than once. So there is almost no risk of coronary infection from blood juices or plasma. However, a person infected with corona is not completely safe even after recovery. This is because the fear of infection persists for up to 36 days after a person becomes infected with the virus. ” In this context, Dr. According to a research paper published in the Lancet medical journal, the coronavirus remains highly active for the first 20 days after entering the human body.
